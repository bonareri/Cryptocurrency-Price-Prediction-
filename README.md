# Cryptocurrecncy Price Prediction
---

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to build a Cryptocurrency Price Prediction system to help traders and investors make data-driven decisions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and predicting price movements can minimize risks, maximize profits, and enhance trading strategies.

Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrencies operate 24/7 and are influenced by factors such as social media trends and global regulations. The project utilizes techniques the following techniques:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XG-Boost.
- **Time series Models**:  ARIMA, SARIMA, PROPHET
- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM

These techniques will provide accurate insights to aid cryptocurrency traders and investors.

## 2. Problem Statement 

Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, making it difficult for traders and investors to make informed decisions. This volatility leads to financial losses, market manipulation, and investment uncertainty. The project aims to address these challenges by predicting future prices using machine learning and statistical analysis, providing data-driven insights, and reducing uncertainty in cryptocurrency trading.

## 3. Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following goals:

- **Analyzing Historical Price Trends** – Study past price trends to understand market behavior and identify patterns.
- **Implementing Machine Learning and Time series Models for Prediction** – Develop and train models like LSTMs, Random Forest, and ARIMA to predict future cryptocurrency prices.
- **Evaluating Model Accuracy and Improving Predictions** – Assess the performance of different models and fine-tune them to improve prediction accuracy.

By accomplishing these objectives, the project will provide reliable and data-driven predictions for cryptocurrency price movements.


## 4. Data Collection

### Data Source

The data for this project is sourced using the following APIs:

- **Price Data:**  
  - **Source:** Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` library  
  - **Data:** Open, high, low, close, and volume metrics.

- **Circulating Supply:**
 - **Source:** CoinGecko API
 - **Data:** The circulating supply is used to calculate the Market Cap of each coin, by multiplying the Close price by the circulating supply during that time period.

### Features in the Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Open** – The price at which the cryptocurrency opened during a specific time period.
- **Close** – The price at which the cryptocurrency closed during the specific time period.
- **High** – The highest price during the time period.
- **Low** – The lowest price during the time period.
- **Volume** – The total number of units traded during the time period.
- **Market Cap** - The total market value of the cryptocurrency during the time period.
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**
  - **EMA_50** – Short-term trend indicator (50-day EMA).
  - **EMA_200** – Long-term trend indicator (200-day EMA).
- **Daily Return:** Measures the percentage change in closing prices between consecutive days.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Identifies overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions.

## 6. Data Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for analysis and model training, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

- **Feature Engineering:** I created additional features such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50, EMA_200), Daily Return, and RSI to gain deeper insights into the price trends.
- **Feature Scalling:** Since the 'Close' prices was not normally distributed, I applied the **Min-Max Scaler** to normalize the data. This transformed the values into a range between 0 and 1, ensuring the model could better learn from the data.
- **Splitting Data into Training & Testing Sets:** The data was split into **80% training** and **20% testing**. This division allowed the model to learn from the majority of the data while being evaluated on a separate testing set, ensuring it can generalize well to new, unseen data.
